SDSC Deployer Service.

.. Further documentation is available on
.. https://sdsc-deployer.readthedocs.io/

Local
-----

::

   $ export FLASK_APP=sdsc_deployer/app.py
   $ flask run

The first time you run the app locally, you may need to build the database tables:

::

    $ flask shell
    >>> from sdsc_deployer.app import db
    >>> db.create_all()


Docker
------

::

   $ docker build --tag sdsc-deployer:latest .
   $ docker run -p 5000:5000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock sdsc-deployer:latest

For development, mount the code directly and enable flask debug mode:

::

   $ docker run -p 5000:5000 \
         -e FLASK_DEBUG=1 \
         -v `pwd`:/code \
         -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
         sdsc-deployer:latest


You can test the API by pointing your browser to http://localhost:5000/v1/ui


Platform integration
--------------------

The deployer can optionally integrate with other SDSC Platform services.
To enable integration, set the appropriate environment variables in the
form of ``<SERVICE_NAME_URL>`` to point to the api URL. For example,
setting ``KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_URL`` will ensure that deployment contexts and
executions are automatically added to the knowledge graph. Note that to
use the resource manager, you will need to additionally set the
``DEPLOYER_JWT_KEY``.
